			Your newborn in week 8</p>

<div class="content">
<p>
Congratulations on your 2-month-old baby! Your little one has probably
added 40-50% to his birth weight and is smiling at you when you enter
the room. At this age, your baby’s brain has grown by 5cm and is “all
brain,” meaning that many of the nutrients you are feeding him are being
used to create new brain cells, allowing him to continue learning new
things at a very rapid rate. Your baby is starting to see colours and
patterns. Your baby may also be experimenting more with his vocal chords and
making new sounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p> Your baby is really starting to notice his surroundings now
and takes an active interest in this exciting new world. You might
notice that your little one stares fixedly at everyone who is not you.
Your baby can tell that person is different from you and is busy working it
all out. Your baby may begin showing more interest in toys that have
more complicated textures, patterns or colours. Make sure you have
plenty of interesting things for them to see, touch and feel. You might
also try exposing them to different kinds of music and notice their
reaction. What is their favourite? </p>
</div>

<p>Communication</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Besides the smiling, your baby will react to your grimaces by smiling
more or imitating them. Remember to make eye contact, big expressions
and to sing or talk to your baby to keep your connection and their brain
growing.</p>
</div>

<p>Movement</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>At this age babies kick, wave, ride bikes with their legs and grab
toys that are hanging above them. When you carry your baby make sure to
hold on tightly since your baby is really strong now and kicks against you.
The head is still wobbly but you can do more tummy-time while watching
your precious one which allows the neck muscles to grow even stronger.
Soon you will notice that your baby will be able to move the head from
left to right. Nearly all babies of this age will flail their arms and
legs at people and objects that they want to play with. Reaching and
grasping is right around the corner! With so many possibilities for
movement, it is very important to never leave babies unattended in
places that are not perfectly safe. Never leave a young baby on an
adult bed, couch, or high surface. You won’t believe how far they can
move, even before they learn to roll or crawl.</p>

<p>Nursing and feeding</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>By now, your baby will show clear signs that they can predict what
will happen during feeding, naptime and socialising. When you latch on,
you might notice kicks into your belly because your baby is so excited to
get onto the breast. Maybe your little one also likes the nappy
change, so make sure to keep it fun by singing to, playing with or
massaging his belly while changing the nappy.</p>
<p>
It is normal for your baby to swallow air and pass more gas, but
excessive gas can make both you and your baby miserable. If you are
breastfeeding, make sure your baby’s lips form a tight seal far back on
your areola. You may want to try covering your baby’s face with a thin
cloth so he doesn’t get distracted while feeding. </p>
<p>
If you are bottle feeding, make sure your baby’s lips fasten on the
wide base of the nipple, not just the tip. Feed your baby smaller
volumes of food more frequently.</p>
<p>
Generally burp your baby at least once during a feeding and then after
a feeding. After feeding you can also try massaging your little one’s
abdomen in a clockwise direction around the belly button. You can
always ask your healthcare provider if there are gas drops that you
could use.</p><p>
