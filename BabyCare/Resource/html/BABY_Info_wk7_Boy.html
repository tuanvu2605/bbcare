			Your newborn in week 7</p>

<div class="content">
<p>
The world is a laboratory for your baby to understand life. You might
notice your baby watching things more at 7 weeks and there may even be
periods of quiet where he is taking it all in. You can feel free to
talk to your baby and describe things even though he cannot yet understand
you. </p>
<p>
It’s time to begin considering a baby carrier and the proper way to
carry your little one. There are so many options and you may want to
try a few with your baby to see which one he likes. The main
question always is: Do I carry my baby in or out? The answer is: always
carry your baby facing in. Here are 7 reasons to not carry your baby
facing out: </p>
<ol><li><p>
Babies like to nap. When a baby falls asleep on the parent while being
carried on your chest, it will have the beneficial opportunity of
sleeping with its head gently turned to one side or the other. This
will also allow for cuddle time. Leaning against the parent also
stimulates a huge amount of neurological integration and development
for the baby.</p>
</li><li><p>
You might notice that when you pick up your baby, he will
instinctively draw the legs into a squat/straddle position. The best
position for your baby’s legs in a carrier are when the knees are up above
the developing hips and your baby is in a squatting posture. If you put your
little one in an outward-facing-carrier, his legs dangle down. This
is not only unsupportive of normal hip development, it may have
negative effects. </p>
</li><li><p>
Your back will hurt when you have your baby face out. You will notice
that you need to shift your hips in order to balance your little one
with dangling legs out. The reason is that you put strain on your
spine. In order to stay aligned make sure to turn your baby facing inward.</p>
</li><li><p>
If your baby faces outward you constantly need to hold your baby’s legs
up or the feet. Your baby will grasp your fingers because it’s off-balance
in this position and they have nothing to hold on to. At the same time
your little one will lean it’s pelvis back (while you shift your hips
forward) for balance. This is unhealthy for hip development and adds
stress to the spine and nervous system.</p>
</li><li><p>
Your baby wants to bond with you. If your little one faces outward
there is no familiar face or “filter”. Your baby won’t feel very safe
because he can’t see you. Facing outward deprives babies of
their natural, innate need for security and communication.</p>
</li><li><p>
When your baby is facing inward it is easy for your baby to have a quick snack on
your breast while you are out and about carrying. This is impossible
for an outward-facing carrier.</p>
</li><li><p>
Baby’s spinal curves will get too much pressure when facing outward. A
newborn only has one curve in the spine, the second one will develop
over the next few years. Right now it’s a “c” curve and during the next few
months baby will first develop the curve in the head/neck area when
starting to lift its head while lying down or starting to crawl. Next
the lower back curve develops when your little one becomes stronger and
crawls longer. If you carry your baby outward, the natural “c” curve
is forced into a reversed position before it has gone through the
normal developmental stages it needs.
