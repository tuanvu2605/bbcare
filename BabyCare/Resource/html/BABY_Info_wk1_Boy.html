<p>
			Your newborn in week 1</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>
Congratulations on the birth of your baby! While you went
through a lot in order to give birth, your little one did too. Being
born is the first big change in your baby’s life and during the first
week it’s all about adjusting to a strange new world. This can mean
getting used to the five senses (touch, sight, sound, taste and smell)
as well as getting used to taking in food and oxygen in a new way. </p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Respiratory system</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Your baby will cough and sneeze out amniotic fluid for the first hours in order to clean out the lungs.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Digestive system</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Be on the lookout for some digestion changes in the first week, such
as the release of meconium, which is the first stool that babies have.
It’s black and sticky and will transition into a more
light-yellow-fluid stool once the intestines are fully working.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Weight</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>All babies will lose about 10% of their birth weight within the
first days after birth so make sure you keep your precious one skin to
skin with you and feed often. Babies usually return to their birth
weight around day 10 of their life. </p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Communication</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Your baby’s eyesight will not be fully developed yet - the best
distance to see you is the so called “breastfeeding-distance” which is
when you hold your baby in your arms. You’ll notice that your baby will
slowly imitate funny faces that you make within a few days. </p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Cord</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
Your baby's cord will heal, but at first the area will be a bit red,
bloody or have a yellowish tint to it. The stump will dry and fall off
once it’s healed underneath. </div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Genitals</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>The genitals can look a little bit swollen or red due to the birth.
This will go away after a few days. Your baby will release brick-dust urine which looks like
red dots in the nappy. This is normal hormonal balancing after
birth.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Skin</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Your baby may develop jaundice and turn a little yellow within the
first days after birth. This yellow skin colour is a leftover product
from the liver working to lower the bilirubin in the blood. Keep your
baby skin to skin, expose him to lots of daylight (not sunlight) and
feed a lot in order to help your baby to lower the bilirubin level on
his own. And don’t forget to mention the jaundice to your healthcare provider
so they can observe your baby closely.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Sleep</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Your baby will sleep between 15 and 18 hours in a 24 hour period.
When your baby sleeps you should try to sleep as well since your normal
sleep pattern will be disrupted. </p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Mood</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>The first week is all about getting to know your baby and recovering
from childbirth. You might experience some self-doubt and nervousness
as the reality of the situation (parenthood!) sets in. Feelings from
love to anxiety, and from happiness to exhaustion, are totally normal.
It’s called the baby blues and usually lasts 2 weeks. Remember to be
patient with yourself and practice gratitude whenever possible.</p>
