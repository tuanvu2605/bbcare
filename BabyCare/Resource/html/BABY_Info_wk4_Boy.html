<p>
			Your newborn in week 4</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>
Your baby is nearly one month old! Soon you will have to entertain your
little one. Right now though it’s still all about feeding and sleeping.
</p>
		</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Feeding pattern</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>You might notice more of a pattern starting to form around feeding.
Your baby will probably still require cluster-feeding at night when he
needs a lot of feeding in order to have enough for the next day. But
you are also able to tell whether your baby is hungry, needs a nappy change
or has colic. You can try to feed a little longer in the evenings now
so you can catch more sleep during the night. </p>
		</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Cord</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>The cord should have healed by now. You will see your baby’s convex belly
button, but during the next months the belly button will change again
and probably get sucked in.</p>
		</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Mobility</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Your baby will move more often and is stronger. You might notice
that your little one can hold his head much better when you burp and
that the finger grip is stronger. Some babies are also able to roll to
their side when you put them down for a nap. Make sure you don’t put
anything else in the crib that could get in front of your baby’s face.</p>
		</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Communication</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>This will be the joy of your lifetime - your baby’s first smile!
Between 3 and 4 weeks babies start smiling wide at their parents which
will pay you back for all the sleepless nights.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Skin</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>You might notice that your precious one's fingernails are getting
long - you can trim them very carefully with a rasp. Make sure you watch
your baby’s fingers closely while doing it. Newborn's finger nails are
very soft and you can easily hurt a little finger. If you notice your
baby is scratching himself in the face despite shorter nails you can
put on a onesie with long sleeves and pull the sleeves over the hands
or get little baby gloves for the same purpose.
</p>
<p>Babies have very soft skin. If you give a daily baby bath make sure
your little one’s skin can handle it. Sometimes the skin gets very dry
— in that case, bathe your baby once or twice a week only. The right
temperature for a newborn bath is body temperature. The best way to
find out whether the temperature is right is to feel it with your wrist
rather than your hand. Your hand is much more used to temperature
changes and you might think the water is too cool when in fact it’s
just right. Prepare a (warm) towel close by that you can put your baby
in once you take him out of the bath. Right after taking a bath babies
like to feed. You can wrap a dry towel around your baby after drying
off and then feed right away with skin-to-skin contact.
