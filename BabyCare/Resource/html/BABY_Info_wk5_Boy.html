Congratulations, your baby is one month old now! How are you feeling?
You might say “I am tired,” “I am happy” or “I can’t believe it’s
already one month!” Above all, give yourself a pat on the back and tell
yourself how proud you are for handling all the duties of a new mum and
coping with all of these changes. Being a new mum or dad is not always
easy.</p>
<p>
Are you still getting enough support? Having a 4-week-old is demanding
since your little one wants more entertainment now. You might notice
when you put your baby down to sleep after a feeding that your baby is
looking around and taking in the environment more. That means more
active time with your baby and possibly less sleep. Try to not squeeze
in too many daily tasks while you are in your new mummy role. Delegate
household tasks to other family members, get professional help or ask
friends to help out.

<p>Postpartum depression</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Postpartum depression hits about 1 out of 7 new mums. Signs of
postpartum depression include sadness, feeling overwhelmed, being
overly tired or not tired at all, feeling imbalanced and generally not
happy. Most often this is a hormonal situation in your body that needs
to get evaluated and treated by a healthcare professional. PPD is still
an illness that many don’t talk about, but looking at the numbers we
know it happens to a lot of new mums — and even dads! If you are
feeling balanced, happy and just more tired than usual, great! If you
are feeling blue, don’t be ashamed. The important thing is to talk to
someone about it. If you notice that your partner is not the same
person anymore don’t hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider. </p>
<p>
Some tips for you to stay calm and relaxed: 
</p>
<p>
</p><ul><li>
<u>Create rituals with your baby:</u> Babies love rituals since it
makes them feel safe and helps in their development. The ritual could
be to change your little one into a sleeping bag at night, sing a
lullaby when changing his nappy, massage your baby every morning or a
give him a baby bath every night. If Daddy (or your baby rearing
partner) always gives your baby a bath, this brings an added layer of
ritual. Encouraging your partner to be involved in this kind of activity helps pull them into the daily routine. </li><p>
</p><li>
<u> Sleep when your baby sleeps:</u> Make sure you are still watching your
sleep. Take a nap during the day when your baby sleeps and keep the lights
dimmed when you feed your baby at night. This will show your little one
that there is nothing interesting going on and he can go right back to
sleep after the feeding. </li><p>
</p><li>
<u> Use the 5 S’s to calm down your baby:</u> Put your <strong>swaddled</strong> baby in your arms on its <strong>side</strong> against your belly while giving your finger to <strong>suckle</strong> on. Then you <strong>sway</strong> back and forth while <strong>shushing</strong> rhythmically in your baby’s ear. After a few minutes your baby will calm down.</li><p>
</p><li>
<u> Treat yourself:</u> What could help you regain your energy and
body? Whether it’s a yoga class, a walk in the park, a massage or good
cup of coffee with a friend. Get out and do something for yourself or
your relationship with your partner. Becoming parents is a big change
and it’s important to stay connected to each other and the outside
world. </li></ul>
