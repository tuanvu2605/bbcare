			Your newborn in week 2</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>
Woo-hoo! You made it through the first week with your newborn! The first
week is usually the hardest. You both are working out your new role as
parents, so be patient with yourself and your partner. By now your baby
is more stable and your body is recovering and feeling stronger.</p>
<p>
Your baby will show a bit more personality by now. You might notice
that he tends to be sleepy while feeding, impatient when changing the
nappy, or loves to listen to Daddy’s voice. At this time babies are
moving in and out of several different states from sleepiness to quiet
alertness to active alertness. </p>
 </div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Weight</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Your baby will have reached his birth weight and started gaining more. This
means you might feed more often or longer. Make sure you rest with your
baby in between feedings so you have enough energy to take care of your
precious one. </p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Communication</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Your baby will react to you and usually loves to be held, kissed and
carried. Baby will hear your voice and turn his head towards you once
you speak. For some reason Dad’s voice can be especially soothing. All
babies love music and rhythm so include that in your daily routine. You
might notice that whenever you put your baby down to sleep, he starts
to cry. This is normal since babies don’t know you are still around
when they don’t smell or feel you.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Cord</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p> The cord will be dryer or already have fallen off. Keep the area dry so it heals well.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Skin</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Many babies develop acne or dry skin after birth. This is a normal
hormonal change and reaction to being outside of the womb. It can take
days or months for baby acne to go away.</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Crying</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>By week two, your baby may be crying more. He might be colicky or
overwhelmed from new encounters like a new sound, person or smell.
Especially in the evening babies develop “cluster-feeding” and are
fussy. Feed often if necessary and keep your baby close to you in a
calm environment.</p>
<p>If your baby cries a lot right after being fed he could be colicky.
You might see your baby extending or pulling up his legs or passing gas.
Sometimes the face turns red from passing a bowel movement. Thankfully,
colic doesn’t last forever and usually it goes away by three months.
</p>
</div>

<div class="subheader">
<p>Mobility</p>
		</div>

		
<div class="content">
<p>Your baby already can hold his head better than a week before. You
might also notice they grab your finger when their hand is stronger.
When you put them on their belly they may make “crawling” movements.
Babies grow really fast so take lots of pictures of those amazing
changes!</p>
<p>Most importantly, your baby may start showing “angel smiles.” These
blissful smiles happen unconsciously during their sleep or after
feedings when they are in a “milk coma.” Your baby will suddenly smile for a
few seconds which will make you the happiest parents in the world!
These smiles will happen more and more over the next few weeks and
usually by week 6 your baby will honestly smile at you and be happy to
see you.
