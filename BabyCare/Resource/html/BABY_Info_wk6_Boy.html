			Your newborn in week 6</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>
At week 6 your baby is not only smiling but wanting to play. At this
age babies will really enjoy some toys or a baby bridge they can gaze
at to keep them fascinated. Whether it’s a sibling playing with them,
finger games, a blanket with different textures, a swim class or a baby
play group, stimulation of the right amount is well received. Dad (or
your birth partner) might want to have baby bonding time. Take
advantage and rest up while they are connecting and having fun!</p>

<p>Welcome to the crying peak!</p>
		</div>


<div class="content">
<p>Usually at 6 weeks babies have a crying peak. Nobody really knows
what causes this, but many ask “is it tummy troubles?” and the answer
is a definite “maybe.” When nothing you do seems to soothe your baby’s
crying, it can feel as if your “I love you, baby” is met with a
screeching wail that suggests the sentiment is not reciprocated. If you
are not sure whether your baby has “world pain” or is actually colicky
here is a colic crying checklist: </p>
<ul><p>
</p><li>
<u>Get a doctor’s exam:</u> Get a thorough exam to make sure there is nothing physically causing pain.
<p>
</p></li><li>
<u>Sleep times:</u> Watch the clock as well as your baby’s sleepy
cues. Colicky babies can be difficult to read and are more sensitive to
sleep needs. </li><p>
</p><li>
<u>Rhythm and sound:</u> Go back to the 5 S’s we learned about last week. Soothing your baby with these can help to calm him down.
</li><p>
</p><li>
<u>Listen:</u> Once you have figured out the timetable for your
baby’s crying spells you can soothe him beforehand. Reduce stimuli,
swaddle or introduce white noise before the time that your baby usually
starts crying. </li><p>
</p><li>
<u>Feeding:</u> Feed your baby in an upright position, and keep the
head elevated for 15 minutes after each feeding to reduce discomfort
from acid reflux. Some degree of acid reflux is common. </li><p>
</p><li>
<u>Mentally prepare:</u> If your baby does have intense crying spells,
go in knowing that it’s not your fault. In fact, it’s not even a
reaction to you. Your little one is just having a hard time and letting
you (and anyone else within earshot) know about it! </li><p>
</p><li>
<u>Positions to relieve gas:</u> There are some positions that babies
who are colicky or cry a lot usually like. Try cradling your baby on
his belly in your arms so your underarm is creating some pressure
against the belly. Or you can try to massage your baby’s belly gently
clockwise around the navel. Moving the legs up and down can
also help to relief gas. Or sit down with your legs closed and put your
crying bundle of joy in your lap facing you. Your baby’s legs push in your
belly, you wrap your arms around your baby’s body and your hands around
your baby’s head. Get very close and talk gently to your baby.
</li></ul>
<p>While crying can sometimes frazzle a new parent’s nerves or cause
them to ask “What did I do, what can I do?” knowing that this is a
natural phase in your baby’s growth helps to make it go more smoothly.
This too shall pass, and before you know it they’ll be asking to borrow
the car keys. Take it all in, crying and all, while you can.</p>
