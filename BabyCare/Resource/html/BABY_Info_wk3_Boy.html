			Your newborn in week 3</p>

<div class="content">
<p>
Hurray, you made it through the first two weeks as a parent! By now you
will probably feel more secure with your little one and your baby-blues
should have diminished. Your hormones are stabilising, but if you still
feel overly emotional, cry a lot or can’t sleep, make sure you have a
lot of support around you.</p>
<p>
Your baby is now in the “Fourth trimester” and you might encounter a
bit more crying. Babies cry more after about 2 weeks since they are
more alert and crying is the only way (for them) to communicate their
needs. As a parent it can be stressful, but there is a lot you can do
in order to help your baby to better transition into this new world. </p>
 <ol><li><p>
Wear your baby. Get a sling that you and your baby like and make sure
your baby is snug towards your body and facing inward. This re-creates
a womb-like feeling for your little one and crying-peaks will be much
less intense.</p>
 </li><li><p>
Skin-to-skin contact continues to be very beneficial for both parents
and baby. Your baby’s blood-sugar, breathing and circulation will
stabilise and they will latch on better when they've been skin-to-skin before
feedings. Both mums and dads relax when their baby is on the chest and this
calms your baby down as well.</p>
 </li><li><p>
Give your baby a bath. By now the umbilical cord most likely has fallen off and
it’s time for your baby’s first bath. Soothing water surrounding your baby
creates an environment similar to what he was used to in the womb. </p>
 </li><li><p>
Swaddling your baby with a breathable wrap is another way to create a
sense of security that was felt in the womb, resulting in a more
settled baby who cries less and sleeps better. Make sure you don’t wrap
your baby too tightly (this has been linked to hip dysplasia) but let your
baby's legs be a bit more loose in the swaddle.</p>
 </li><li><p>
Breastfeed your baby whenever he wants. Newborn babies feed often,
because they will be working to establish supply and re-filling their
fast-emptying, tiny tummy. </p></li><li><p>
Move your baby. Babies like to be pushed around in a pushchair, rocked
or bounced in a crib or carried in a sling. This buoyant and fluid type
of movement reminds them of the womb.</p>
 </li><li><p>
Find some white noise your baby might like since they are used to
hearing the sounds of the womb. There were digestion noises, your
heartbeat, sounds from the outer world and blood rushing by. If you
re-create a balanced noise-level it will help your baby to calm down.
You can use a CD with heartbeat-sounds, ocean waves, soft music or your
vacuum cleaner, and of course the Lullabies and White Noise tools available in this app.<br>
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
Simulating womb-like experiences for your baby at this time is a great
way to soothe and ease them into the world, and can be relaxing for you
too. </p>
<p>If you are a new dad, you might wonder where you fit in? If you look
at the above suggestions you can see that there is not much you can do,
besides wearing your baby and getting to know him, and communicating
with your partner. Listen to your partner, help her recover from birth
and don’t get worried if she is still in a baby-blues phase. Remember
to listen to yourself too and discover what works and what doesn’t in
your new life.</p>
